Title = {Dynamic change of international arms trade network structure and its
   influence mechanism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 27},
Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to analyze the dynamic changes of
   the arms trade network not only from the network structure but also the
   influence mechanism from the aspects of the economy, politics, security,
   strategy and transaction costs.Design/methodology/approachThe study
   employs the Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model and the Separable
   Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model to analyze the endogenous
   network structure effect, the attribute effect and the exogenous network
   effect of 47 major arms trading countries from 2015 to 2020.FindingsThe
   results show that the international arms trade market is unevenly
   distributed, and there are great differences in military technology.
   There is a fixed hierarchical structure in the arms trade, but the rise
   of emerging countries is expected to break this situation. In
   international arms trade relations, economic forces dominate, followed
   by political, security and strategic factors.Practical
   implicationsEconomic and political factors play an important role in the
   arms trade. Therefore, countries should strive to improve their economic
   strength and military technology. Also, countries should increase
   political mutual trust and gain a foothold in the industrial chain of
   arms production to enhance their military power.Originality/valueThe
   contribution of this paper is to analyze the special trade area of arms
   trade from a dynamic network perspective by incorporating economic,
   political, security, strategic and transaction cost factors together
   into the TERGM and STERGM models.},

Title = {How do alliances trade arms? Political alliance networks and global arms
   transfers},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The arms trade has come to the center stage of the international
   political economy. Yet only a few quantitative studies have been
   conducted on the political economy of the arms trade. This paper focuses
   on the security rents shared by trading partners in determining their
   arms trade relationship. We argue that the mechanism of reciprocity is
   better understood from the perspective of an international alliance
   network. Because the rents are likely to be transferred to other related
   members in a community, when a state is engaged in an arms deal with
   another state, it takes into account not only the direct dyadic
   relationship but also the alliance community to which the other state
   belongs. Based on this understanding, we employ social network analysis
   (SNA) to identify the effect of the international alliance community on
   the arms trade. Our findings suggest that if two states have a tie in a
   political alliance network, they are also likely to have a tie in the
   arms sale network. Moreover, we also find that the alliance network is a
   strong predictor of bilateral arms sales. Being in the same alliance
   community encourages two states to trade more arms with each other.},

   random graph models},
Journal = {STAT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Model-based clustering of time-evolving networks has emerged as one of
   the important research topics in statistical network analysis. It is a
   fundamental research question to model time-varying network parameters.
   However, due to difficulties in modelling functional network parameters,
   there is little progress in the current literature to model time-varying
   network parameters effectively. In this work, we model network
   parameters as univariate nonparametric functions instead of constants.
   We effectively estimate those functional network parameters in temporal
   exponential-family random graph models using a kernel regression
   technique and a local likelihood approach. Furthermore, we propose a
   semiparametric finite mixture of temporal exponential-family random
   graph models by adopting finite mixture models, which simultaneously
   allows both modelling and detecting groups in time-evolving networks.
   Also, we use a conditional likelihood to construct an effective model
   selection criterion and network cross-validation to choose an optimal
   bandwidth. The power of our method is demonstrated in simulation studies
   and real-world applications to dynamic international trade networks and
   dynamic arm trade networks.},

Abstract = {This study identifies security-related factors affecting the formation
   of the global arms trade network. This empirical analysis using a
   quantitative approach includes data from multiple sources (the Global
   Peace Index, Political Stability Index, Democracy Index, Global
   Terrorism Index, Fragile State Index, and military expenditure as a
   percentage of GDP) and multiple states analyzed using the ERGM. Arms
   trade data related to six attributes of states representing their
   (in)stability is collected and analyzed for 2012-2018. Our findings are
   as follows: (1) states with greater internal stability import more arms,
   which affects the formation of the global arms trade network; (2) states
   with greater external instability import more arms, which also affects
   the formation of the global arms trade network. This study makes two
   academic contributions, as follows. First, we analyze factors that form
   the global arms trade network from a holistic or systemic perspective.
   Second, we analyze those factors empirically and statistically from a
   security perspective.},

Abstract = {What determines the volumes of international weapon transfers? And why
   do countries establish such arms trading relationships in the first
   place? We propose an innovative statistical strategy that builds on the
   gravity approach and combines a Heckman model with a network analysis.
   This allows us, for the first time, to analyze the impact of network
   structures on both the extensive and the intensive margins of the
   international arms trade simultaneously. We argue that the structure of
   the arms transfer network conveys important information for exporting
   and importing countries. Therefore, past topological properties of the
   trade network play a central role in its future evolution. Using data on
   the trade of major conventional weapons between 1955 and 2018, our
   estimation results and out-of-sample predictions show that network
   structures have considerable explanatory power with respect to the
   creation of trade links. They are far less relevant for the explanation
   of trade volumes, which are mainly determined by demand factors.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyse the network of international major
   conventional weapons (MCW) transfers from 1950 to 2016, based on data
   from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The
   dataset consists of yearly bilateral arms transfers between pairs of
   countries, which allows us to conceive of the individual relationships
   as part of an overall trade network. For the analysis, we extend the
   separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) to account
   for time-varying effects on both the network level (trade network) and
   the actor level (country effects). Our investigation enables the
   identification of potentially differing driving forces that influence
   the formation of new trade relationships versus the persistence of
   existing ones. In accordance with political economy models, we expect
   security- and network-related covariates to be most important for the
   formation of transfers, whereas repeated transfers should prevalently be
   determined by the importers' market size and military spending. Our
   proposed modelling approach corroborates the hypothesis and quantifies
   the corresponding effects. Additionally, we subject the time-varying
   heterogeneity effects to a functional principal component analysis. This
   analysis serves as an exploratory tool and allows us to identify
   countries with exceptional increases or decreases in their tendency to
   import and export weapons.},

Abstract = {The anarchic international system is actually heavily structured:
   communities of states join together for common benefit; strong states
   form hierarchical relationships with weak states to enforce order and
   achieve preferred outcomes. Breaking from prior research, we
   conceptualize structures such as community and hierarchy as properties
   of networks of states' interactions that can capture unobserved
   constraints in state behavior, constraints that may reduce conflict. We
   offer two claims. One, common membership in trade communities pacifies
   to the extent that breaking trade ties would entail high switching
   costs: thus, we expect heavy arms trade, more than most types of
   commercial trade, to reduce intracommunity conflict. Two, this is driven
   by hierarchical communities in which strong states can use high
   switching costs as leverage to constrain conflict between weaker states
   in the community. We find empirical support for these claims using a
   time-dependent multilayer network model and a new measure of hierarchy
   based on network centrality.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyse dependence structures among international
   trade flows of major conventional weapons from 1952 to 2016. We employ a
   Network Disturbance Model commonly used in inferential network analysis
   and spatial econometrics. The dependence structure is represented by
   pre-defined weight matrices that allow for correlating flows from the
   network of international arms exchange. Three dependence structures are
   proposed, representing sender-, receiver- and sender-receiver-related
   dependencies. The appropriateness of the presumed structures is
   comparatively assessed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). It
   turns out that the dependence structure among the arms trade flows is
   complex and can be represented best by a specification that relates each
   arms trade flow to all exports and imports of the sending and the
   receiving state. Controlling for exogenous variables, we find that the
   trade volume increases with the GDP of the sending and the receiving
   state while the impact of geographical distance, regime dissimilarity
   and formal alliance membership is rather small.},

Abstract = {Using the SIPRI Arms Transfers Database covering all trade in military
   equipment over the period 1950-2018, we examine the relationship between
   countries from a novel empirical perspective. We consider the arms
   transfers network as a multiplex network where each layer corresponds to
   a particular armament category. First, we analyze how different layers
   overlap and elucidate main ties between countries. Second, we consider
   different patterns of trade in order to identify countries specializing
   on particular armament categories and analyze how they change their
   export structure in dynamic. We also examine how countries influence
   each other at different layers of multiplex network. Finally, we analyze
   the influence of countries in the whole network.},

Abstract = {Given the growing number of available tools for modeling dynamic
   networks, the choice of a suitable model becomes central. The goal of
   this survey is to provide an overview of tie-oriented dynamic network
   models. The survey is focused on introducing binary network models with
   their corresponding assumptions, advantages, and shortfalls. The models
   are divided according to generating processes, operating in discrete and
   continuous time. First, we introduce the temporal exponential random
   graph model (TERGM) and the separable TERGM (STERGM), both being
   time-discrete models. These models are then contrasted with continuous
   process models, focusing on the relational event model (REM). We
   additionally show how the REM can handle time-clustered observations,
   that is, continuous-time data observed at discrete time points. Besides
   the discussion of theoretical properties and fitting procedures, we
   specifically focus on the application of the models on two networks that
   represent international arms transfers and email exchange, respectively.
   The data allow to demonstrate the applicability and interpretation of
   the network models.},

Abstract = {Since few states are able to produce all of their own military hardware,
   a majority of countries' military systems rely on weapon imports. The
   structure of the international defense technology exchange network
   remains an important puzzle to understand, along with the factors that
   drive its evolution. Drawing on a political economy model of arms
   supply, we propose a new network-oriented explanation for the worldwide
   transactions of major conventional weapons in the period after World War
   II. Using temporal exponential random graph models, our dynamic approach
   illustrates how network dependencies and the relative weighting of
   economic versus security considerations vary over time. One of our major
   results is to demonstrate how security considerations started regaining
   importance over economic ones after 2001. Additionally, our model
   exhibits strong out-of-sample predictive performance, with network
   dependencies contributing to model improvement especially after the Cold
   War.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The academic study of defense cooperation focuses heavily on formal
   military alliances. Yet, governments rarely sign new alliances, and the
   global alliance structure has remained relatively static for decades. By
   contrast, governments are increasingly active in defense cooperation
   agreements (DCAs). These bilateral framework treaties institutionalize
   their signatories' day-to-day defense relations, facilitating such
   wide-ranging activities as defense policy coordination, joint research
   and development, weapons production and arms trade, joint military
   exercises, training and exchange programs, peacekeeping, and information
   exchange. Nearly 2,000 DCAs have been signed since 1980. Preliminary
   evidence suggests that DCAs impact numerous security, military, and
   defense outcomes and that governments increasingly incorporate DCAs as
   core elements of their security strategies. This article introduces the
   new DCA Dataset (DCAD). I provide a brief historical background on DCAs
   and compare them to other commonly studied forms of defense cooperation.
   I then explain coding standards and describe the data set in detail.
   Finally, I illustrate applications of DCAD to militarized interstate
   disputes and arms trade.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the impact of a new form of defense cooperation -
   formal weapons cooperation agreements, or WCAs - on the global arms
   trade. WCAs are bilateral framework agreements that establish
   comprehensive guidelines on the development, production, and exchange of
   conventional arms. Substantively, WCAs regulate such core areas as
   procurement and contracting, defense-based research and development, and
   defense industrial cooperation. These agreements have proliferated
   dramatically since the mid-1990s. They now number nearly 700, with 30-40
   new WCAs signed each year. Newly collected data are used to analyze the
   effect of WCAs on import and export of conventional weapons. To control
   for interdependencies in the formation of WCAs, and to account for the
   mutually endogenous relationship between WCAs and weapons flows, WCAs
   are modeled as an interdependent network that coevolves with the
   individual-level arms trade activity of states. The analysis shows that,
   over the 1995-2010 period, WCAs have significantly increased weapons
   flows.},

Abstract = {Small arms and light weapons are the primary causes of death in the
   violent conflicts raging today. Although the small arms trade is
   difficult to track, and the illicit trade doubly so, a wealth of
   information is available. This article applies some basic tools of
   social network analysis (SNA) to reveal the high profile of former
   Soviet bloc countries in the illicit arms trade with Africa. I set up
   this analysis with a discussion of the features of social networks that
   allow them to facilitate the transfer of illicit weaponry, and follow
   the presentation of my findings with some explanations for the
   prominence of Russia and other post-communist countries in this trade.
   My discussion focuses on the importance of relationships, their quantity
   and quality, as providing opportunities for, and constraints on, the
   flow of material and social resources between the actors and locales
   that comprise the illicit arms trade network. I also highlight the
   extent to which the positions of key players may account for their power
   within the network and their roles in security governance, which in the
   illicit context requires the maintenance of secrecy and redundancy.},

Abstract = {Using SIPRI data on all international transfers of major conventional
   weapons 1950-2007, we study the relationship between differences in
   polity and arms trade. To study whether states tend to trade arms within
   their political vicinity we estimate gravity models of the likelihood of
   trade at the bilateral level and study the evolution of the global
   network over time. We find a stable negative relationship between
   differences in polity and the likelihood of arms trade for the duration
   of the Cold War, but not in recent years. In line with these results,
   the global arms trade network changes drastically over the sample period
   in several respects: it grows more dense, clustered and decentralized
   over time. The differences between the NATO and Warsaw Pact sub-networks
   that we find corroborate the common perception that the Warsaw Pact was
   more strongly centralized around the USSR than NATO around the UK, the
   US and France. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (3) (2014) 535-551.

Abstract = {The international community can be viewed as a set of networks
   manifested through various transnational activities. The availability of
   longitudinal data sets such as international arms trades and United
   Nations General Assembly (UNGA) allows for the study of state-driven
   interactions over time. In parallel to this top-down approach, the
   recent emergence of social media is fostering a bottom-up and
   citizen-driven avenue for international relations (IRs). The comparison
   of these two network types offers a new lens to study the alignment
   between states and their people. This article presents a network-driven
   approach to analyze communities as they are established through
   different forms of bottom-up (e.g., Twitter) and top-down (e.g., UNGA
   voting records and international arms trade records) IRs. By
   constructing and comparing different network communities, we were able
   to evaluate the similarities between state-driven and citizen-driven
   networks. In order to validate our approach we identified communities in
   UNGA voting records during and after the Cold War. Our approach showed
   that the similarity between UNGA communities during and after the Cold
   War was 0.55 and 0.81, respectively (in a 0-1 scale). To explore the
   state- versus citizen-driven interactions, we focused on the recent
   events in Syria within Twitter over a sample period of 1 month. The
   analysis of these data show a clear misalignment (0.25) between
   citizen-formed international networks and the ones established by the
   Syrian government (e.g., through its UNGA voting patterns).},
